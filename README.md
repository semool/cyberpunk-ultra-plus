# Cyberpunk Ultra+ Control

## Goals
1. **Improve path tracing for as many people as possible**
  a. Speed up PT as much as possible ("Fast") so more people can play it
  b. Improve PT quality (reducing edge and boiling noise) for high-end PCs and those sensitive to PT noise
  c. Ray tracing + path tracing for AMD and lower-powered PCs
3. **Change modes in real-time** so users can see differences for themselves
4. **Fix PT / RT bugs** that can be fixed via engine manipulation
5. **Improve game stability**

## Contributing

Please feel free to pitch in! I don't know LUA or ImGui and have limited time, so help is wonderful. This is a proof of concept.
